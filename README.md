# MovieHunter - Movie and Series Exploration App

## Description

MovieHunter is a React-based application that provides users with a seamless way to explore movies and series. It allows users to search for titles and view detailed information such as posters, names, release dates, durations, genres, IMDb ratings, summaries, actors, and directors. Users can rate movies and add them to a personal watchlist while tracking stats like the number of movies watched and calculating averages for IMDb ratings, personal ratings, and movie durations.

This project was created as a practical implementation of my React knowledge, focusing on using tools like `fetch` for API calls, `useRef` for managing component references, and custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic. A custom package was also developed to streamline these features. Note: responsiveness and design are not a priority for this version but may be improved in the future.
